How it works?
Scans the page > send data to AI > AI give out appropriate values > extension fill it live in front of user

What data we store?
Resume, AI generated cover letters (For users to track), User details whatever user gives in context dump, Jobs user has applied.
As this is important to accurately fill the applications

There are 4 tabs in popup mentioned above

For beta usage this server works by estimating how many users are there and how many applications can we fill each day for users (900 approximately) every day combined for all users.
