The index.html, styles.css and script.js } combined known as SET Dark matter

Find what's the missing connections with all the other files as an extension fileset?

popup files will exist but these new 3 files are under settings/ folder and this will overlay over the screen when POPUP button is clicked. And instead of popup these will openup

I have this set dark matter as frontend, I want to fully connect it with background, content and manifest

Make sure everything is well connected with debugging statements everywhere to print any issue in console

Do not include "Autofill" in settings panel
